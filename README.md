# BrainStorming

Target audience:
* Assume no prereqs
* students taking traditional intro stats class in a small college environment 


## Principles

* Data/science pipeline
* Visualization
* Minimizing prerequisites to research
* Tidy data as a representation of:
    + Multivariate relationships
    + Variable types
    + Starting point of "data pipeline" AKA "science pipeline" 
* Reproducibility: the greatest collaborator you'll ever have is yourself in a few years
* Introduce statistical inference via computing/resampling/randomization. quantifying uncertaint


## Datasets

* nycflights
* babynames


## Topics Needed

* Definitely need a good preamble: Intro to stats (what is it?  what is data science? how do they relate?)
* What are variables? What are observational units? Explanatory/Response, Categorical/Continuous
* Data visualization (what makes a good plot given a problem setup?  why do we choose one plot over another?)
* Data tidying/reshaping/manipulation/summarizing
* Data analysis
    + Developing traditional inference from randomization
    + Showing what happens when assumptions/conditions arenâ€™t met
    + Comparing non-parametric and parametric methods
    + Confidence intervals
    + Interpretation of results
    + Regression/correlation/multiple regression
    + 60% Confidence Intervals

## Topics to be Dropped

* Independence/Probability
* Chi-Square Tests
* Logistic Regression
* CLT (but we need to ascertain the unintended consequences of dropping it)
