# BrainStorming

Target audience: students taking traditional intro stats class in a small college environment

## Principles

* Data/science pipeline
* Visualization
* Minimizing prerequisites to research
* Tidy data as a representation of:
    + Multivariate relationships
    + Variable types
    + Starting point of "data pipeline" AKA "science pipeline" 
* Reproducibility: the greatest collaborator you'll ever have is yourself in a few years
* Inference/statistical, or whatever that means: quantifying uncertainty
* 

## Topics

* Definitely need a good preamble: Intro to stats (what is it?  what is data science? how do they relate?)
* What are variables? What are observational units? Explanatory/Response, Categorical/Continuous
* Data visualization (what makes a good plot given a problem setup?  why do we choose one plot over another?)
* Data tidying/reshaping/manipulation/summarizing
* Data analysis
    + Randomization/simulation
    + Developing traditional inference from randomization
    + Showing what happens when assumptions/conditions arenâ€™t met
    + Comparing non-parametric and parametric methods
    + Confidence intervals
    + Interpretation of results
