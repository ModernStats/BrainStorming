# Pending questions
1. Does data manipulation come before data viz?
1. Restrict types of plots:
  + histogram: as long as we avoid density plots
  + boxplot: have to set x=1 aes. categorical variables
  + barplot: issue with categorical variables
  + scatterplot: none
  + linegraph:
  + Need a way to track all issues/FAQ's

# Things to add to book
1. Implement `tidy`, `augment`, and `glance` in `broom` package to get results
